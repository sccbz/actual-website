            <h2>✧ Drawing</h2>
            <p>
                I have taken drawing after my dad who is a visual artist. I enjoy drawing portraits from time to time and learning new stuff about anatomy, colour theory, and blending! I can do both traditional and digital drawing.

        <div class="skill-card lace">
            <h2>✧ Writing</h2>
            <p>
                I have also gained a talent for writing! I can say that I have a pretty wide and creative thinking for ideas for different forms of writing, mostly for stories. I love playing with words since by doing that you give more taste, feeling, and style to your writing.

        <div class="skill-card lace">
            <h2>✧ Memorization</h2>
            <p>
                Another skill I have is that I can memorize words easily. It's just a skill that I have adapted randomly, but it shows a lot. Playing puzzle games like sudoku and nonogram enhanced my thinking skills, making more space for easy memorization! This skill helps me keep my mind fresh and retain new knowledges.
