    <h1>Hobbies !!! (｡>ㅅ<｡)</h1>

    <div class="hobbies-box lace">
        My hobbies are eating, coding, and listening to music! Mostly when those three are combined, I often take that as my relaxation-time. Although I have many more hobbies, I consider these top three my favourite. I tend to explore new food every once and a while, sometimes taking my time to critique it! And for coding, I enjoy it as a hobby because my dream course is I.T., so taking it as a hobby at first is a fun and enjoyable way to learn. And while last but not the least, listening to music. Music brings joy to my heart, no matter what the genre it is, classical, indie, punk rock, etc., as long as it sounds good, I consider adding it to my playlist! Although my top five favourite music artists are firstly Stray kids, second is 3OH!3, then DVWN, Blink-182, and lastly is Bruno Mars!  ♡
